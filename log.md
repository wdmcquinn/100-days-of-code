# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1st, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started over on Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts:** Today i got the project started on codepen. I decided on codepen for portability as I move from laptop to desktop to tablet about 10 times a day. 

I was able to get the basic html and css layout done and a little of the javascript. Tomorrow i want to focus on the function to check for a winning move.

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018
**Today's Progress**: More work on FCC - Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts:** I worked on mostly the function to detect a win today. Im not sure its the most elegant way to do it but it seems to be more accurate and faster than some of the ways i tried. I also fixed a bug on the reset function and found out how to delay a function from firing using setTimeout. I used this to display a Message to the user before resetting the game.

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished up the first version of my FCC - Tic Tac Tow Project.

**Thoughs:** In the future i would like to come back to this project and try to implement a better AI. The next project is simon. It looks like there will be a lot of new things to implement.

### Day 6: January 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on some of the javascript for my simon project.

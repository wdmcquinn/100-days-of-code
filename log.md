# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1st, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started over on Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts:** Today i got the project started on codepen. I decided on codepen for portability as I move from laptop to desktop to tablet about 10 times a day. 

I was able to get the basic html and css layout done and a little of the javascript. Tomorrow i want to focus on the function to check for a winning move.

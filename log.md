# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Doug McQuinn]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1st, 2018].

## Log

### R1D0 
Restarted my Tic Tac Toe Project for @freecodecamp.

### R1D1
More work on the Tic Tac Toe Project. 
I worked on mostly the function to detect a win today. Im not sure its the most elegant way to do it but it seems to be more accurate and faster than some of the ways i tried. I also fixed a bug on the reset function and found out how to delay a function from firing using setTimeout. I used this to display a Message to the user before resetting the game.

### R1D2
Finished up the first version of my FCC - Tic Tac Tow Project.

 In the future i would like to come back to this project and try to implement a better AI. The next project is simon. It looks like there will be a lot of new things to implement.

### R1D5
Finished up the HTML and most of the css for the simon priject. 
got a good start on the Javascript as well.

### R1D6
Worked on some of the javascript for my simon project.

Will need a good way to flash the buttons for the AI. Im thinking about a css class and then adding the class and removeing it for each element in the array.
